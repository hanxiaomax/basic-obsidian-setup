# basic-obsidian-setup

Basic obsidian setup for my workplace. 

## Theme
Customized [Deep Work](https://github.com/nikbrunner/obsidian-deep-work-theme). 
- Add colors to the customized tag(@tag style)
- Add emoji to the MOC notes

Those customization can also be done with [Supercharged Links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links) and [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

There is also an customized theme call Minimal-nite, it is from the [minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) and [Obsidianite](https://github.com/bennyxguo/Obsidian-Obsidianite) with some personal adjustments. which I used for a long time, but the daly light verison is not good and I really need some sunshine so I switched to [Deep Work](https://github.com/nikbrunner/obsidian-deep-work-theme)
